Obviously, if you've made it this far, you've figured out that the user name
for this machine is 'ubuntu'.  This user as full sudo access without a
password, though you can set one if you like.

Disk structure

Note about disk structure here....


PostgreSQL

The postgres database name is "drupal", and the primary user for that database
is also called drupal.  See the database connection parameters in
/var/www/sites/default/settings.php for more information.  There is also
a postgres account named ubuntu (the same as the login shell user name) that
has superuser privelges.  This account has its postgres "search_path" set 
so that it looks in the Chado schema before the public schema, and so this
account should be used when using tools that are intended to interact with
Chado (like GBrowse, Apollo and any command line tools from GMOD).


Drupal

Version 6.28 of Drupal was obtained from http://drupal.org/ and installed
in /var/www, so that when navigating with a web browser to the Apache
document root (i. e., http://127.0.0.1/ or whatever IP address Amazon
assigns your machine), you will get the Drupal home page.  The administrative
account name is "ubuntu" (the same as the shell login name) and the password
is "gmod".  YOU SHOULD CHANGE THIS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! On the public instance
at http://cloud.gmod.org/ I already did.


Tripal

Tripal is installed via an svn checkout at

   /var/www/sites/all/modules/tripal-svn

and can be updated by doing an "svn update", but then using the created
theme directory to replace the theme directory in /var/www/sites/all/themes/
but preserving the "tripal" name in the themes directory.

Tripal was used to install the Chado 1.2 schema and load ontologies and
a GFF file containing yeast genome annotations from SGD, downloaded from
yeastgenome.org:

  http://downloads.yeastgenome.org/curation/chromosomal_feature/saccharomyces_cerevisiae.gff

as well as Pythium ultimum data downloaded from here:

  http://icebox.lbl.gov/webapollo/data/pyu_data.tgz

This data was provided by Mark Yandell's lab.


GBrowse2

The version of GBrowse2 that is installed on this machine is 2.54.  It was
installed using the CPAN shell.  The configuration file for the yeast Chado
database is /data/etc/gbrowse2/07.chado.conf and the P. ultimum config is
ultimum.conf.


JBrowse

The JBrowse version that was installed on this machine is 1.9.3 installed from
a zip file obtained from http://jbrowse.org/ and is installed in 
/var/www/jbrowse, so that navigating to http://your.ip.address/jbrowse
will give the page.  The configuration file for defining database connection
parameters and created tracks is in the home directory: ~/jbrowse.conf.

Chado

While Chado schema version 1.2  was installed by Tripal, the Chado software
package is an svn checkout at ~/sources/chado, and the command line 
scripts for Chado where installed from here.  This checkout can be updated
with "svn update" like the Tripal svn checkout and then updated scripts
can be installed via the standard installation method for Perl modules
(perl Makefile.PL, make, sudo make install).
