Obviously, if you've made it this far, you've figured out that the user name
for this machine is 'ubuntu'.  This user as full sudo access without a
password, though you can set one if you like.

PostgreSQL

The postgres database name is "drupal", and the primary user for that database
is also called drupal.  See the database connection parameters in
/var/www/sites/default/settings.php for more information.  There is also
a postgres account named ubuntu (the same as the login shell user name) that
has superuser privelges.  This account has its postgres "search_path" set 
so that it looks in the Chado schema before the public schema, and so this
account should be used when using tools that are intended to interact with
Chado (like GBrowse, Apollo and any command line tools from GMOD).

Drupal

Version 6.22 of Drupal was obtained from http://drupal.org/ and installed
in /var/www, so that when navigating with a web browser to the Apache
document root (i. e., http://127.0.0.1/ or whatever IP address Amazon
assigns your machine), you will get the Drupal home page.  The administrative
account name is "ubuntu" (the same as the shell login name) and the password
is "gmod".  You should change this as soon as possible!

Tripal

Tripal is installed via an svn checkout at

   /var/www/sites/all/modules/tripal-svn

and can be updated by doing an "svn update", but then using the created
theme directory to replace the theme directory in /var/www/sites/all/themes/
but preserving the "tripal" name in the themes directory.

Tripal was used to install the Chado 1.1 schema and load ontologies and
a GFF file containing yeast genome annotations from SGD, downloaded from
yeastgenome.org:

  http://downloads.yeastgenome.org/curation/chromosomal_feature/saccharomyces_cerevisiae.gff

GBrowse2

The version of GBrowse2 that is installed on this machine is 2.42, and
it is installed from a git repository in the home directory (~/GBrowse).
Updated versions of GBrowse2 can be installed from this directory after
doing a "git pull" to freshen the directory.  The configuration file for
the Chado database is /etc/gbrowse2/07.chado.conf.

Minor bug work around: a bug in the Tripal GFF3 loader improperly sets
featureloc.rank to 1 as the default rather than 0.  This change results in
GBrowse being unable to see any features.  To fix this, merely execute
this query:

  UPDATE chado.featureloc SET chado.featureloc.rank = 0
     WHERE chado.featureloc.rank=1;

JBrowse

The JBrowse version that was installed on this machine is 1.1 installed from
a zip file obtained from http://jbrowse.org/ and is installed in 
/var/www/jbrowse, so that navigating to http://your.ip.address/jbrowse
will give the page.  The configuration file for defining database connection
parameters and created tracks is in the home directory: ~/jbrowse.conf.

Chado

While Chado schema version 1.1  was installed by Tripal, the Chado software
package is in the home directory, ~/schema/chado, and was used to update the 
schema to version 1.23 and to install many utility scripts via the standard
installation method for Perl modules (perl Makefile.PL, make, sudo make
install).  This checkout can be updated with "svn update" like the Tripal
svn checkout.
