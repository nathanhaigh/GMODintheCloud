GMOD in the Cloud version 2

Obviously, if you've made it this far, you've figured out that the user name
for this machine is 'ubuntu'.  This user as full sudo access without a
password, though you can set one if you like.

For up to date information on software installed on this machine, go to
http://gmod.org/wiki/Cloud.

The password for the ubuntu user in the Drupal instance is "gmod".  You should 
change that as soon as possible.
